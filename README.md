If you're looking for a beamer presentation theme, take a look at [Auriga].

## FAQ

At the moment, we **do not** have our own Wiki or FAQ for this project.
However, please see the [FAQ] from the original project, as it may answer some
of the questions.

Here are some tips you may want to be aware of those:
- By default, the `stanford` style is used in the `poster.tex` file.
  If you would like to make your own style, please read the original project's
  Wiki and [FAQ].
- We provide several logos for Stanford and our group in the `logos` directory.
  If you would like to modify which logo you'd like to use, look for the Logo
  section in the `poster.tex` file to make your changes.
  By default, we use Stanford + our group name and the Stanford Tree at the top.


## Themes

Gemini currently includes three color themes:

* `stanford` (default)
* `gemini`
* `mit`
* `labsix`

The alternative themes are intended to be inspiration for you to make your own
color theme.
You're highly recommended to make your own color theme (it's really easy!)
or use the default Stanford theme.
To use one of the other themes, simply update the line `usecolortheme{}` in
`poster.tex` to one of the above mentioned themes.
Or use your own theme, e.g. `awesome` (assuming your theme is in the file
`beamercolorthemeawesome.sty`)
